This repository contains the code necessary to have an unbeatable computer player in the classic video game of 2D pong. The computer player was trained using deep learning techniques on images from human vs. human gameplay.

To see the unbeatable AI pong paddle in action, you simply need to run "ai_pong_pixel.py," which should run assuming you have Pygame and Numpy installed.
